# feed-read-py
CLI RSS reader in python3

# Plans
After messing around with computers from a young age I thought it was time to finally do a bigger project.
I plan to make this an RSS feed reader that is run in the terminal that has no major dependencies.
To do this I will need to make:

- A method to retrieve feeds
- A way to parse these feeds
- A way to display these feeds to the user
- A way to respond to input from the user

When these essentials are in place I will be able to add other improvements.
